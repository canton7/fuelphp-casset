	/**
	 * Groups of scripts.
	 * You can predefine groups of js and css scripts which can be enabled/disabled
	 * and rendered.
	 * There isn't much flexibility in this syntax, and no error-checking is performed,
	 * so please be careful!
	 *
	 * The groups array follows the following structure:
	 * array(
	 *    'js' => array(
	 *       'group_name' => array(
	 *          'files' => array(
	 *             array('file1.js', 'file1.min.js'),
	 *             'file2.js'
	 *          ),
	 *          'enabled' => true,
	 *          'min' => false,
	 *       ),
	 *       'group_name_2' => array(.....),
	 *    ),
	 *    'css' => aarray(
	 *       'group_name' => array(
	 *          'files' => array(
	 *             array('file1.css', 'file1.min.css'),
	 *             'file2.css',
	 *          ),
	 *          'enabled' => true,
	 *			'deps' => array('some_other_group'),
	 *       ),
	 *       'group_name_2' => array(.....),
	 *    ),
	 * ),
	 *
	 * - 'js' and 'css' are special keys, used by functions like render_js and
	 *    render_css. Either can happily be omitted.
	 * - 'group_name' is a user-defined group name. Files can be added to a
	 *    particular group using the third argument of css() or js().
	 *    Similarly, individual groups can be rendered by passing the group
	 *    name to render_css() or render_js().
	 *    Another point to note is that each group is minified into its own
	 *    distinct cache file. This is a compromise between allowing the
	 *    browser to cache files, and flooding it with too many files.
	 * - 'files' is a list of the files present in the group.
	 *    Each file can either be defined by a string, or by an array of 2 elements.
	 *    If the string form is used, the file will be minified using an internal
	 *    library when 'min' = true.
	 *    If the array form is used, the second element in the array is used
	 *    when 'min' = true. This is useful when a library also provided a minified
	 *    version of itself (eg jquery).
	 * - 'enabled': whether the group will be rendered when render_css() or
	 *    render_js() is called.
	 * - 'min: an optional key, allowing you to override the global 'min' config
	 *    key on a per-group basis. If null or not specified, the 'min' config
	 *    key will be used.
	 *    Using this,
	 * - 'deps': an optional key, allowing you to specify other groups
	 *    which are automatically rendered when this group is. See the readme
	 *    for more details.
